            <h1>Performance Banksy</h3> 

            <div>
                <p>Widely known and regarded as the most famous artist of our time, Banksy is an anonymous street performance artist who earned his fame through graffiti murals that carried a message of introspection and change. Many of his most popular works have a clear anti-war moral and performative aspect, shown by him risking his life to paint murals on the dangerous Israeli West Bank barrier showing peace through torn chunks, as well as allowing property owners to demolish, tear down, or sell any of his illegally placed works. His message for peace is taking place at a prime time in history, with the start of the ongoing Syrian civil war as well as the ever-present Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the art directed at trying to find a diplomatic solution to all disputes. Banksy uses the performative aspect of his art in order to promote his beliefs of anti-war, using media and heavily viewed areas to help his art gain more traction. To Banksy, performance is just as important as the subject for his art, because that is what helps get the message of peace out to the masses, and what gets the everyday person to consider what is going on in the world. He uses the reactions people have to his art, the media shockwaves he generates, and the power of location to convince people to consider solutions to conflict rather than the brutality of war.</p>
                <p>Many Banksy pieces are similar in a lot of ways, like the stenciled graffiti style he predominantly uses for every work, however, the component that carries across almost all of his art is his message of anti-war. Banksy uses his performances, his art, and anything he can in order to protest against ongoing conflicts. His most influential mural was Girl with Balloon, a painting illegally done on the side of Waterloo Bridge in South Bank depicting a little girl reaching out towards a red, heart-shaped balloon that is being carried away by the wind. The sadness in her face alongside her body language conveys an obvious heartbreak, the mural representing peace being torn away from this innocent young girl by forces beyond her control. Beside her, Banksy writes “there is always hope”, hoping to sway viewers to consider the conflicts around the world and take the time to imagine the lives being taken because of a war they have no part in (“Banksy Girl With Balloon (2004), Meaning & Description, My Art Broker”). Banksy proceeded to paint hundreds of small canvas versions of this piece to sell at galleries and other places, to raise awareness for the ongoing Syrian civil war. The war was started when “poorly armed and ill-trained rebels [...] began fighting a guerilla-style war against the Syrian military” in order to overthrow the Syrian government (Ahmed 3). This war has taken so many lives, many of which were college students, children, and families who have no part in the conflict; which is what Banksy is trying to raise awareness for. The small canvas prints were very widespread, which only allowed his message to spread even further. It allowed the viewer to see similarities between the innocent girl’s heart being torn away in the mural, and the innocent people in Syria caught between two warring sides, ripping away their peace and their dreams. This influential artist has used his pieces and the far-reaching nature of his works to convey anti-war sentiments, and to try to convince the everyday person around the world to do what they can to prevent conflicts.</p>
                <p>A performative aspect that Banksy uses for many pieces is the media attention his murals attract. Most of the performance happens after the mural is created, using social media to take his art further and to make a statement over social platforms. The responses to his works are a key part of his performance, almost considered a continuation of his works and messages. The most popular “continuation” of his art is with hashtags supporting the people influenced by the civil war in Syria and recreations of his art and style. A tweet from a well-known human rights activist shows “Syrian street artists making a statement... Reminiscent of #Banksy #WithSyria”, (Kilroy) connecting Banksy’s famous style to Syrian artists replicating his signature approach to anti-war. The hashtag “#WithSyria” is used repeatedly in conjunction with Banksy art, using his sentiment and argument against the conflict in Syria to raise support and awareness for the devastation being brought upon innocent families and children, in the hopes that people from around the world will try to help and make a change. Banksy understands that his pieces can only go so far, which is why he supports the continued use of his art and his message, and why it is a continuation of the performative aspect he uses. His performance is used to spread the message of each piece farther than any literal painting could ever hope to reach, and to give a voice and a place to share experiences to these people that are being oppressed.</p>
                <p>One of the most influential sets of murals Banksy has created were the several done on the Israeli-Palestinian West Bank barrier wall. The Israeli-Palestinian wall was created in September of the year 2000 after terrorist attacks on Israel from Palestine, and during the Second Intifada - a Palestinian uprising against Israel. The barrier was developed because of extreme hostility between two groups of people, and has since heightened suspicion between the groups. Banksy used the symbol of conflict and distrust that is the West Bank wall in order to convince politicians, leaders, and even the everyday person to recognize that the wall is doing more harm than good. It is raising suspicion, hatred, and racism, while also causing an immense loss of lives in the overall conflict. Banksy shows his strong anti-war sentiments in many of his performance pieces, however, this is likely one of the most volatile sets of murals he has created. One of the wall pieces, Unwelcome Intervention, depicts a pair of young boys building a sandcastle, while a painted hole in the wall above them shows off lush tropical beaches, palm trees, and a bright ocean. This mural is a prime example of Banksy’s value on location for his pieces and the importance of the work’s environment in the performative aspect of his art. The placement upon this contested wall displays the gravity of war better than anything else, and helps transmit the subject and message deeper into the hearts of the viewer. Similarly, because this wall is so well defended, Banksy was threatened with firearms and fired rounds as he was painting his pieces, showcasing how much danger there is due to the wall and the political turmoil between these two nations. The children playing in the sand help the viewer realize that the lives of unconnected and innocent people are at stake in a conflict that has been around for longer than they have been alive, conveying the peaceful, paradisiacal life and the “better political landscape [that] could only emerge if the barrier were destroyed” (“Banksy Artworks”). Banksy’s performance along the West Bank wall have shown many people worldwide the dangers and injustice of an ongoing conflict, and have caused leaders, politicians, and everyday people to think twice about the quarrel that has been going on, and consider peace as an option to disputes instead of the destruction of war.</p>
                <p>Capitalism and the standard American lifestyle is a topic Banksy pokes at with many of his pieces. Shown vividly in his piece Napalm, capitalism and America are the main perpetrators of many of the world's war atrocities (“Napalm by Banksy”). Depicting Mickey Mouse and Ronald McDonald holding hands with the famous photographed girl from an American napalm attack on a Vietnamese village, Banksy is criticizing the carelessness for human lives that the American military shows, killing people indiscriminately in enemy territory. By using the two most well-known American symbols - Disney and McDonald’s - America is the obvious recipient of criticism, and by implementing the hand-holding with the Vietnamese girl it seems as if these American symbols are the ones leading her into the pain and terror. The criticism of capitalism leads perfectly into his criticism of war, and this piece argues that they go hand in hand. The greed for more and to be on top always leads to people fighting others for nothing more than materials and resources. Banksy critiques the way Americans live, showing that pure Capitalism leads to brutality and war, and everyone has to consider options aside from conflict to get the things that they need and prevent the destruction that comes with the choice to go to war with others.</p>
                <p>Banksy uses many different figurative tools to make his messages spread to as many people as he can reach. One such tool that has given him an edge in the art world is his anonymity. Banksy is a performer, and part of that performance is the fact that nobody has publicly shared who Banksy is; if they even know who is behind the mask. Because of how popular he has become, more attention is given to him as enthusiasts try to solve the mystery of his identity, and spread his works - and consequently his tag - around different communities in the hopes of somebody recognizing the street artist. However, the anonymity also grants Banksy protection, so that he can do more risky things with his performances, like trespassing, breaking into places, and painting murals in illegal locations, making his performance more interesting and risky. Similarly, if nobody knows Banksy’s identity, nobody is able to sue him for property damage, or arrest him, which allows him to go further than many other influential artists limited by fame.</p>
                <p>With risk comes a pay-off; however Banksy receives almost none of the money for any of his pieces that get sold, so for him, there is no literal pay-off, only the reward of seeing the messages of his art being spread around galleries and social circles. The combination of anonymity and absence of payment only strengthens his statement of philanthropy, showing that he only does this art for the message, the performance, and for other people. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Banksy created a painting labeled Game Changer that he gave to an auction house, “with proceeds benefiting British public health charities” (Vanhoose) who are working overtime to save those infected with COVID-19. Over 23 million dollars were raised and donated in entirety to the hospitals that needed the money to save more people. Banksy practices the messages he preaches, using his influence to save the lives of many. Just as the money has done a great deal on the people, the painting itself conveyed strong praise for the health care workers, depicting a young boy playing with a doctor toy instead of the superhero toys he has in a basket on the floor. The millions of dollars that the auction house raised also heightened the attention on the art, conveying to those who viewed it the heroic nature of the overworked health workers. Philanthropy is an important aspect of his art, and is a performance itself. Selling his pieces for millions of dollars, and making almost no money off of it takes very serious willpower, and makes a loud statement. His determination to his message is made obvious by this unpaid performance, which takes his name and his art much further into the world.</p>
                <p>One of the main devices Banksy uses in his performance art is the reactions of the people who view his art. In the modern, ever-evolving world we live in, Banksy’s art utilizes the new mediums and technologies available to continue the spread of his art and fame. In “Banksy’s recent street pieces [he leaves] blank space in the artwork where people have the opportunity to pose with the artwork” (Ulrich 55) as a way to allow his pieces to travel over Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and many other social media sources. Banksy makes many of his pieces accessible and people friendly, because the everyday man is the intended viewer for many of the pieces. Hashtags his art generates, media crazes he designs with selfie holes, and the visible placement of the works allows people near and far to view his art, and contemplate his message, which is the most important part of his art. Banksy illegally paints pieces in many locations, aware that any shop owner or government official could tear it down at any moment so that these people can see it on their everyday walks. The illegality and the risk of destruction helps everyday viewers see his message, whether it is on the way to work or walking on the street, and allows them to think about the purpose during their commute, and go home later to view the piece again and contemplate on the message more. Similarly, the destruction of his art generates shockwaves through the world; since he is a famous and an extremely popular artist, communities are angry and disappointed when his pieces are painted over or destroyed, talking to each other about the importance of the art, and in turn the anti-war sentiments that were relating to relevant figures and symbols. Banksy uses these responses, his fame, and his ability to speak to the masses through a painted medium in order to continue his performance, and unite people against war and conflict.</p>
                <p>One of the elements of Banksy’s art that makes his performance art so popular is the obviousness of each piece’s message. Banksy “has influenced a broad heterogeneous community and the easy readability of the message, which he wishes to give in this fame, also contributes” (Esra 175) to his popularity amongst the people of the world. His art gives other people easy works to replicate and copy in their own style in order to convey specific messages. His art allows people to immediately grasp the message, and ruminate on their own as they continue throughout the day. Banksy uses this easy-to-grasp nature of his art in order to increase the depth of the message as well as the distance the concept travels. The easy readability and simplicity of most of his art also make the performative aspects much easier; for instance, his stenciled graffiti should take very minimal time when compared to other painting types, allowing him to complete an entire painting in restricted zones and illegal places with a much lower likelihood of being caught.</p>
                <p>Banksy incorporates many unique elements into his performance art in order to spread his message as far as possible. The philanthropic nature that he has shown thus far combined with his boldness and risk-taking behavior helps convince viewers of his art to consider his calls for peace and love, and use his ideas to spread their own peace sentiments. The location of Banksy’s art contributes greatly to the meaning and delivery of his works, which only helps him illuminate the things wrong with this world and war, and his love for media shockwaves and extensions of his art assists him in his fight for peace. Overall, Banksy is a performance artist that has used his fame to fight against war and destruction, and because of his wishes for peace and prosperity, he has become one of the most well-known artists of this time period.</p>

            <h1>Addendum</h1>
            
            <p>I decided to use Times New Roman font for the paper, because Times New Roman is a formal font, and is what the paper is originally in. I made the author/class/etc. bold because it makes it more obvious when it was written, and by whom, and draws the eyes. I also increased the font size of the whole thing to size 14pt font, because it feels more readable with a little larger of a font, and I increased the font size of the h1 headers to 32pt to make them stand out a lot. I added padding to the headers, so they would float more in the middle of the text, and give the viewer a break from a straight wall of text. I made the background color gray, and the paper color white to differentiate between the paper and the background. I also added a box shadow to the paper to make it pop out of the page a little, and show a defined area for the text. I added padding around the paper's text so that there would be a text margin, which makes it easier to read, and look like a better page. I created a hanging indent in the works cited p because it is the official way to do works cited sources in MLA format. Finally, I aligned the paper to the center of the page, because I think it looks better with the paper in the middle, and I aligned the titles to the center, because it helps divide each section of the paper/page up.</p>
