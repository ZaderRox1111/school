    <h2>Serving Fonts</h2>
    <p>The way that I am aquiring fonts is through an import of a public url from google fonts. First, the page sends a request out to the google fonts api, which gives the page the data for the font you requested, which is then imported into either the css file, or the head of the html file. I imported it into the css file for my case. I then grabbed the css stylesheet from the directory it resides in and added it as a link in the head of this page.</p>
